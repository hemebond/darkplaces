# Obviously, we do need XML:
GENERATE_XML = YES

# You may also want to turn the generation of HTML off:
GENERATE_HTML = NO

# Next, choose the location of the resulting XML database:
XML_OUTPUT = xml

# Program listing vastly increases the size of XML so it's recommended
# to turning it OFF:
XML_PROGRAMLISTING = NO

# The next one is essential! Sphinx uses lowercase reference IDs,
# so Doxygen can't use mixed-case IDs:
CASE_SENSE_NAMES = NO

# The next one is important for C++ projects -- otherwise Doxygen
# may generate lots of bogus links to template arguments:
HIDE_UNDOC_RELATIONS = YES

# The last one is not essential, but recommended if your project
# sets AUTOLINK_SUPPORT to ON (like most projects do) -- otherwise
# auto-generated links may point to discarded items:
EXTRACT_ALL = YES
